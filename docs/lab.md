# The local rtpengine lab

A Docker Compose lab that runs a **real rtpengine** against `mediaserverd`, so
the tap path can be exercised without the production stack — and, on a Mac,
without native rtpengine at all (there is none: its kernel fast path is a
Linux netfilter module and no Homebrew formula exists).

Nothing here needs OpenSIPS or FreeSWITCH. rtpengine accepts `offer`/`answer`
over NG directly, so `lab/call_driver.py` plays both endpoints and the
signalling proxy between them, then pumps G.711 for both legs.

## Running it

```sh
cd lab
mkdir -p out && chmod 777 out
docker compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
python3 - <<'PY'
import wave; w = wave.open("out/tap.wav"); print(w.getnchannels(), w.getframerate(), w.getnframes())
PY
```

Addresses are static (`172.31.99.0/24`) because the shipped image is
distroless and has no shell to discover its own IP: rtpengine `.10`, the call
driver `.20`, `mediaserverd` `.30`. `MSS_TAP_LOCAL_IP` must therefore be a
literal, and all RTP stays inside the Linux VM — Docker Desktop on macOS has
no real `--network host`, so crossing the host boundary is the fragile path.

Startup order is enforced by the driver's healthcheck: it writes a marker file
once the call is live and pumping, and `mediaserverd` has
`depends_on: condition: service_healthy`, so the tap is never requested before
the call exists.

`lab/ng_probe.py` is the smaller tool: it creates a call, asks for a tap, and
prints rtpengine's raw replies. Use it first when something is wrong, since it
removes our Rust from the picture entirely.

Note `tmpfs: [/rec]` on the rtpengine service. The image's bundled config sets
`recording-method=pcap` with `recording-dir=/rec`, and rtpengine **exits** if
that directory is not writable.

## What this lab proves, and what it cannot

Confirmed against **rtpengine 14.1.1.8** (2026-08-14):

- `ping`, `offer`, `answer`, `subscribe request`, `unsubscribe` and `delete`
  all return `result=ok` for the exact datagram shapes `rtpengine-ng` builds.
  A two-tag `subscribe request` yields one `m=` section per tag, each
  `a=sendonly` — the shape `sdp.rs` was designed for.
- The real offer is pinned as a parser fixture
  (`parses_a_real_rtpengine_14_subscribe_offer`), which caught something the
  hand-written fixture had backwards: rtpengine emits **no session-level `c=`
  line at all**, only a media-level `c=` after each `m=`. Media-level
  precedence is not a nicety here, it is the only source of the address.
- `a=rtcp:` attributes appear and are ignored harmlessly.

It cannot give:

- **Capacity numbers.** A Docker VM on a laptop is not production-shaped
  hardware. Per-tap CPU at 100/500/1000 taps stays a Linux-host job, and it is
  the actual M2 exit criterion.
- **Kernel-module behavior** (`--table=-1` here). Minor for taps, since
  subscription legs are userspace work anyway.
- **Production signalling behavior**: hold/unhold as FreeSWITCH emits it,
  transfer moving a leg to a different rtpengine instance, re-anchoring.
- **Your deployed version's support.** This proves 14.1.1.8 works. The
  version running in production is a separate question and still open.

## What the lab found and fixed

**rtpengine rejects a subscription answer that drops the offered
`telephone-event` payload type.** The first real run failed with
`Failed to process subscription answer`, having offered `RTP/AVP 0 101` and
received `RTP/AVP 0` back from us. `lab/ng_answer_probe.py` isolated it by
trying four answer shapes against fresh subscriptions:

| Answer | rtpengine |
| --- | --- |
| PCMU only (what `sdp.rs` emitted) | **REJECTED** |
| PCMU + telephone-event | ACCEPTED |
| media-level `c=` instead of session-level | ACCEPTED |
| echo of rtpengine's offer, ports and direction swapped | ACCEPTED |

So the payload-type list is the cause, not the connection-line placement.
`SubscriptionAnswer::to_sdp` now parses `a=rtpmap:` per stream and echoes the
offered telephone-event payload type and its clock rate alongside the audio
codec, per stream, omitting it when the offer has none.

This was worth more than an unblocked lab. Answering with PCMU alone would
have meant **no RFC 4733 packets on any tap**, so `firstDtmf` and
`dtmfResult` — frozen the legacy stream fsm contracts (Constitution VII) — would have
gone silently missing in Phase 1, with `StreamPipeline`'s detector wired to a
payload type nothing was sending. It also means the telephone-event payload
type is now taken from the offer instead of assuming 101, which is
conventional but never guaranteed.

Successful run, 2026-08-14, 15s tap of both legs: 691 datagrams per leg, 691
frames played, **zero** concealed / lost / duplicated / late / reset /
unparsable / recv-error, both legs sample-aligned at 119,840 samples, 749
releases, 0 reanchors, and a 2-channel 8 kHz WAV of 14.98s carrying distinct
audio per channel. The 58 underruns per leg are the driver pumping slightly
under 50 packets/s against the pacer, not a pipeline fault.

## Findings still open

1. **No `a=label:` in the subscription offer.** `set-label` was sent on the
   `subscribe request` and the reply carries no label attribute, so
   `OfferedStream::label` is `None` and the label logging in `tap_session.rs`
   cannot confirm which leg is which. Track assignment by offer order is the
   only option available; it is presumed to follow `from-tags` order, and
   that presumption is still untested — a two-leg tap with deliberately
   different audio per leg would settle it.
2. **DTMF has not actually been observed on a tap.** The answer now
   negotiates telephone-event, but the driver never sends RFC 4733, so
   `dtmf_digits` stayed 0. Teaching `call_driver.py` to send a digit is the
   direct way to prove the frozen contract end to end.
